# Cloud Sync Conflicts

This project lives in a cloud-synced folder (d:\Sync\). The sync tool creates "conflicted copy" files (e.g. `file (LAPTOP-XXX conflicted copy 2026-...).ext`) both in the working tree and inside `.git/`.

## Before any git commit or push:

1. Find and delete all conflicted copies:
   - Use `Glob` with pattern `**/*conflicted*` in both the project root AND `.git/` directory
   - Delete all found files
2. Only then proceed with `git add`, `commit`, `push`

## If `git pull` or `git push` fails with "bad object" or "did not send all necessary objects":
- Check `.git/` for conflicted copies, delete them, retry
